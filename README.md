###User stories to work with:
#### Write a Review of team: 3 days - 40
#### Select a game style: 2 days - 10
#### Set user preferences: 4 days - 30
#### Create a new team: 5 days - 10
#### Delete a lineup: 3 days - 20
#### Delete a player: 3 days - 20
#### Favorite teams save feature: 3 days - 50
#### Live feed fantasy tips: 4 days - 50
#### Search community teams: 3 days  - 30

###Total days: 30 days of work

##Priorities to work with:	
####20x, 30x, 40x, 10x, 30x, 50x, 20x, 10x, 50x

#Plan A:
###(30 day iteration, 2 developers, 0.7 velocity)
###20, 30, 40, 10, 30, 50, 20, 10, 50

###With velocity: 43 days (rounded up)
###2 people x 30 day iteration x 0.7 = 42 days total to finish
###One iteration will be <= 30 days
###Second iteration will be 12 days

##Organized
###Select game style = 2 days, priority of 10
	#-velocity: 3 days
###Create a new Team = 5 days, priority of 10
	#-velocity: 7 days
###Delete a player = 3 days, priority 20
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Delete a lineup = 3 days, priority 20
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Set User Preferences = 4 days, priority 30
	#-velocity: 6 days
###Search Community teams = 3 days, priority 30
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Write review of a team = 3 days, priority 40
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Favorite team save feature = 3 days, priority 50
	#-velocity: 4 days

###Velocity days: 49 days

##ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account: 27 days
###Select game style = 3 days, priority of 10
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority of 10
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20
###Set User Preferences = 6 days, priority 30

####ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account: 12 days	
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#Plan B:
###(User added 2 additional user stories at priority 10) - assume you were at the 
###end of the first iteration when these were introduced.
###For the 2 new stories: 1 is a feature, the other is an emergency:
###20, 30, 40, 10, 30, 50, 20, 10, 50, 10(new), 10(emergency)

##NOW 10 user stories:

##Organized
###Emergency user story = 3 days, priority 10
	-velocity: 4 days
###New feature user story = 3 days, priority 10
	-velocity: 4 days
###Select game style = 2 days, priority of 10
	-velocity: 3 days
###Create a new Team = 5 days, priority of 10
	-velocity: 7 days
###Delete a player = 3 days, priority 20
	-velocity: 4 days
###Delete a lineup = 3 days, priority 20
	-velocity: 4 days
###Set User Preferences = 4 days, priority 30
	-velocity: 6 days
###Search Community teams = 3 days, priority 30
	-velocity: 4 days
###Write review of a team = 3 days, priority 40
	-velocity: 4 days
###Favorite team save feature = 3 days, priority 50
	-velocity: 4 days


###With velocity: 43 days (rounded up)
###2 people x 30 day iteration x 0.7 = 42 days total to finish
###One iteration will be 29 days
###Second iteration will be 14 days

##NEW ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account and emergency story: NOW: 29 days
###Select game style = 3 days, priority 10
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority 10
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20
###EMERGENCY Story = 4 days, priority 10 
###NEW USER FEATURE = 3 days, priority 10
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30

##NEW ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account and extra feature: NOW 14 days	
###Set User Preferences = 6 days, priority 30
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50

##Reality scenario
##ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account: 26 days
###Select game style = 3 days, priority of 10 - completed
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority of 10 - completed
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20 - completed
###EMERGENCY STORY = 4 days. priority 10 -- now working on
###New user story = 4 days, priority 10
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20

##ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account: 18 days
###Set User Preferences = 6 days, priority 30	
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50

### What happened: 
### Because of the new stories that were added while at the end of Iteration 1, We would
### have to push a 6 day user story to the next iteration, making iteration shorter in the long run,
### but now iteration 2 has 18 days. Note that the NEW FEATURE user story is immediatly after emergency.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
##Plan C:
###(A user-story with a non-trivial estimate is taking 2x longer)
###20, 30, 40, 10, 30, 50, 20, 10, 50
###With velocity: 43 days (rounded up)
##2 people x 30 day iteration x 0.7 = 42 days total to finish

##Organized
###Select game style = 2 days, priority 10
	#-velocity: 3 days
###Create a new Team = 5 days, priority 10
	#-velocity: 7 days
###Delete a player = 3 days, priority 20
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Delete a lineup = 3 days, priority 20
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Set User Preferences = 8 days, priority 30
	#-velocity: 11 days
###Search Community teams = 3 days, priority 30
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Write review of a team = 3 days, priority 40
	#-velocity: 4 days
###Favorite team save feature = 3 days, priority 50
	#-velocity: 4 days

###Velocity days: 49 days

##NEW ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account, 2x longer story: 29 days
###Select game style = 3 days, priority of 10
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority of 10
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20
###Set User Preferences = 11 days, priority 30

##NEW ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account, 2x longer story: 12 days	
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50

####How to adjust for this scenario: Luckily, iteration 1 had enough
####room to accomodate the larger time period for the non-trivial user story.

##Reality scenario
##ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account and emergency story: NOW: 24 days
###Select game style = 3 days, priority of 10 - completed
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority of 10 - completed
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20 - completed
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20 - completed
###EMERGENCY Story = 3 days, priority 10 - completed
###NEW USER FEATURE = 3 days, priority 10 - in progress

##ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account and extra feature: NOW 23 days	
###Set User Preferences = 11 days, priority 30
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50

###In the reality scenario, we were sprung with a problem with our last user story taking
###longer, therefore we needed to post pone the 2x longer story to the next iteration,
###and swap out a smaller time estimated storyfrom iteration 2 for the last part of iteration 
###1. This made the total of iteration one into 24 total work days, and increased iteration 2
###to 23 days of work.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Plan D: 
###(The other developer is taken for another project)(Lone wolf style)	
###-At the start of the last iteration of your current plan	
###1 x 30 x 0.7 = 21 days of actual work solo with 0.7 velocity in 30 day	
###However, 8 days remain of actual work, with 11 days to spare	

##NEW ITERATION 1 with velocity taken into account: 18 days	
###Select game style = 3 days, priority of 10	
###Create a new Team = 7 days days, priority of 10	
###Delete a player = 4 days, priority 20	
###Delete a lineup = 4 days, priority 20	


##NEW ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account: 18 days
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30
###Set User Preferences = 6 days, priority 30	
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50

##Reality scenario
##ITERATION 2 with velocity taken into account and extra feature and 1 developer: 19 days	
###Set User Preferences = 11 days, priority 30		
###Search Community teams = 4 days, priority 30	
###Write review of a team = 4 days, priority 40	

##ITERATION 3 with velocity taken into account and extra feature and 1 developer: 4 days
###Favorite team save feature = 4 days, priority 50	

####What happened: At the beggining of iteration 2, a developer was switched from project, thus having
####to re-evaluate the velocity with work days and re adjust an iteration plan. This time a single worker
####will get 21 days of work done in a 30 day iteration at a velocity of 70%. This caused a change in iteration
####2 that had to push "Favorite team save feature" to a brand new iteration to guarentee that user stories
####will all be completed within the given iteration.
