				     accepted estimation was _3 days_.

				     for another person's profile to see their line
				     ups.
###Show top _n_ lineups(DUPLICATE) - 
				     Show the _n_ best lineups currently registered 
				     the app. The option would allow user to see a list
				     of usernames and their team lineup's place.

##Revisions
There were no revisions that were decided on. We felt pretty confident after our last meeting
that these were solid estimations for the scope of these user storys.

#Details of the process and the procedures that were followed
Starting with the name, our team began by brainstorming ideas for a name for the team. This 
was a 20 minute discussion that ended with deciding on a list of names with "Death Star" at the top
of the list. Our next meeting we played poker to decide on which app idea would be our development
choice. 

These ideas were:
	**Automation App**
		An application that automates certain tasks on your phone and provides small macro 
		features as well. You will be able to create a task that will do something based on 
		a location or a time. Also will be able to do a small script that does multiple tasks.
	**Chat Enhancer**
		An application that enhances a standard messenger giving the userâ€™s the ability to 
		query and display sports stats, quotes, and pictures.
	**Microphone app**
		An application that acts as a microphone by using numerous other peoples phones 
		speakerphone.  The app would allow users to connect to your phone and when you 
		spoke out of your phone it would come out of all the other peoples phones.
	**Fantasy Football**
		An application that would build a fantasy football lineup for the user based off of 
		a few parameters preset by the developer. The app would allow for mass creation and 
		randomization of sports fantasy lineups for daily or season leagues.

Once the team's software target was established, we moved to figuring out the user stories for the
target. We had an agreement to bring _at least_ 6 user stories to the table for our next meeting. We
gathered for the next meeting and sorted our stories based on likeness, scope, and elegance. Two of
my stories were accepted while the other four were either duplicates or out-of-scope. Our next 
meeting we played poker again but this time it was for the user story time estimates. The 
estimates for each task were played and the variance to our ultimate choices were very small. 
Finally, we had to develop tasks for each user story. Currently we have one user story's tasks
planned out. 
There are 6 of them:
######Sport Class(Estimation: 2 days)
######Create Scheme(Estimation: 2 days)
######Team Preference Class(Estimation: 4 days)
######Create a Team(Estimation: 2 days)
######SQL Interface(Estimation: 3 days)
######Create UI Class(Estimation: 5 days)
These were decided on a mixture of playing poker and general discussion. 

#How the team interaction worked:
The interations with each other has been very smooth. We all tend to have the same idea on the 
scope of certain pieces to the project. There has been a couple brief debates between members on
what tasks should be used for a user story, but that is a healthy given.

#What **did** and **did not** work and observations of the process:
I feel like playing poker is a great process for seeing everyones ideas and deciding based on
majority vote. If the mode of a given set of cards does not exist, then we will take the average
of the overall cards given that their are no outliers to throw of the average. I felt that general
discussion with no organization of what to do tends to lead to longer meeting times and less 
production. This was present in earlier meetings due to getting to know each other and figuring 
out a direction. As time went on, things began to get smoother, we started using the method of
playing poker and that ended up being very successful in fast, efficient meetings.
